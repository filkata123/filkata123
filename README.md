## Projects

### Virtual Reality üï∂Ô∏è
[Inverse Kinematics Example](https://github.com/filkata123/InverseKinematicsExample): showcasing how to implement inverse kinematics in Unity.

[DID Simulation](https://github.com/filkata123/DID_Simulation): a Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) Simulation that builds empathy

[VR Horopter](https://github.com/filkata123/VRHoropter): investigating how different single-eye rendering techniques can manipulate vision and simulate motion on a dotted horopter surface.

[LightPainter](https://github.com/filkata123/LightPainter)/[UnrealArchitecture](https://github.com/filkata123/UnrealArchitecture): two projects that create a virtual 3D painter and a traversal simulator in Unreal 4 for an online course

[VR minor files](https://github.com/filkata123/vr-minor): the unfortunate leftovers of an amazing project done during a VR minor on a privately-hosted gitlab instance. See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8djb-Sg1Us0) for a showcase.

### Embedded Software Development üõ∞Ô∏è
[One Click Connect](https://github.com/filkata123/One-Click-Connect): enabling RaspberryPi to ESP8266 communication through RF with the click of a button

[Linux Driver Repo](https://github.com/filkata123/Embedded-Systems-6): this repo contains multiple linux drivers implemented for a course together with two other developers


### Simulations / Python üêÄ
[RSSTP](https://github.com/filkata123/RSSTP): testing platform for a robotic sensorimotor system

[FindTheInfected](https://github.com/filkata123/game-find-the-infected): small CLI multiplayer game that showcases the power of Docker

Most of my python simulation work has been set to private on the request of my university supervisors. Nevertheless the projects can be showcased upon request so feel free to ask me more about them!

Thank you for stopping by! üòä
